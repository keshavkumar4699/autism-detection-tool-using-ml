# AutismDetectionTool
The "Autism Detection Tool" is a Python project that utilizes a tweaked algorithm based on the core Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms to provide accurate results for the AQ-10 dataset. This tool aims to detect autism in individuals by analyzing their responses to a set of questions.

Implemented in Python, the project focuses on developing a robust algorithm that optimizes accuracy. By combining the strengths of Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms, the tool can effectively analyze the provided dataset and classify individuals as either autistic or non-autistic.

The core algorithm has been fine-tuned and customized to ensure the best possible accuracy for the specific AQ-10 dataset. This dataset contains a set of carefully selected questions that are known to be indicators of autism. By utilizing the algorithm, the Autism Detection Tool can provide reliable predictions regarding an individual's autism status based on their responses to these questions.

The project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming and machine learning techniques, specifically in the domain of classification algorithms. It emphasizes the importance of accuracy in autism detection and strives to provide the most optimal results by leveraging a tweaked version of the Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms.

Overall, the Autism Detection Tool offers a Python-based solution that utilizes a customized algorithm to accurately detect autism based on the provided AQ-10 dataset. It serves as a valuable resource in the field of autism diagnosis and contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve detection and support for individuals on the autism spectrum.
